Creating a tour/tutorial
------------------------
we may thing to 2 differents way to create tutorials:
 - using AT objects inside plone
 - via paster creating more packages in the collective.amberjack namespace
we could do both.

 * ajmetatour needs to be completed
	a tour is an AT
		it's composed by macrosteps (another AT)
			(no more inner levels steps as AT)
	the tour and the associated js should appear dinamically
	register a tour? use a workflow state to define who sees what?
 * the whole aj can manage branches like 'if you are not logged in, then, log in'

 * using selenium!?

 * tours using paster
	register a tour


Others
------
 * load the js stuff only if the tour is running
 * check if the user really completes the macrostep
 * check if the texts entered in the fields are the ones we expected. if not we may have problems with ids and with the xcontent.
 * need to think to a different (or alternative way) to identify the page form the html it produces. xpath and xcontent may non be enought because of translations
 * create a portlet on which a user can select the tour choosing between the registered ones / created ones
 * create a temporary tutorial area for each tutorial running. delete it as soon as the tutorial exits or in some way quits
 * let the popup be movable and resizable, maybe an handle may help.
